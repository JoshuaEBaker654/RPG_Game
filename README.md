This project is a turn-based RPG combat simulator developed in C#. It features object-oriented programming principles to manage player attributes, enemy waves, combat logic, item drops, and spellcasting mechanics.

The player progresses through multiple waves of enemies, each increasing in difficulty. Gameplay includes attacking enemies, casting spells, and using items like health and mana potions. Each enemy and the player has unique attributes such as health, speed, and attack strength, which influence combat order and outcomes.

<b>Key components include:</b>
<ul>
<li>Player & Enemy Classes: Encapsulate combat stats, attacks, and interaction logic.</li>

<li>CombatManager: Controls turn order, player/enemy decisions, and combat resolution.</li>

<li>WaveManager & WaveGenerator: Create dynamic waves of enemies with scaling difficulty.</li>

<li>Spell & Item Systems: Allow players to learn and cast spells and manage inventory.</li>

<li>Drop Generation: Introduces randomized potion drops from defeated enemies.</li>
</ul>
